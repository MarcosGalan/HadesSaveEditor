# 🛠 Building HadesEditor

How to generate the executable for both **Mac** and **Windows**.

---

### 1. Requirements
*   Python 3.13+
*   Dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pyqt5 construct luabins lz4 pyinstaller
    ```

### 2. Generating for Mac (.app)
Run this command from your terminal:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "hadeseditor" main.py
```
After the build, you will find `dist/hadeseditor.app` (the complete app bundle) and `dist/hadeseditor` (the single executable binary).

### 3. Generating for Windows (.exe)
Since **PyInstaller** builds for the system it's currently running on, you **must** run this command from a Windows PC or Virtual Machine:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "hadeseditor" main.py
```
This will result in `dist/hadeseditor.exe`.

> [!NOTE]
> Since we use **PyQt5**, cross-compilation (e.g. building for Windows from a Mac) is not directly supported without complex setups (Wine/Docker). It is always safer to build the binary on the actual target OS.
